## ⚠ WARNING
The server cpu benchmark is discontinued, Because some netcodes aren't tick-based and almost impossible to be measured. We only want to measure the time taken by processing ticks or packets.

## Specs

- Ryzen 5 5600
- RTX 3050
- 32GB RAM 3200MHz

## Netcode Version

| Netcode | Version | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fusion | 1.1.8 F 725 | Realtime |
| Fusion 2 | 2.0.0 RC 797 | Realtime |
| Netick | Netick 2 Beta 0.8.8 | LiteNetLib |
| NGO | 1.2.0 | Unity Transport |
| Fishnet | 3.11.10 | Tugboat |
| Mirror | 86.4.0 | KCP |

## Netick

- Server port: 25565
- Default Transform Settings
    - Teleport Distance: 50
    - Precision 3
    - Sync Position & Rotation,
    - Compress Pos & Rot
    - Compress Rot Aggressively
- Issue: Object position sync is late upon spawn

## Fusion v1

- Client port: 40000+ (Random)
- Server port: 40000+ (Random)
- Default Transform Settings
- Delta Snapshot

## Fishnet

- Default Transform Settings
- Server port: 25565
- Uses `TimeManager.OnTick`

### NGO

- Default Transform Settings
- Server port: 25565
- Uses `FixedUpdate()` at 20hz
- Issue: object interpolate from 0,0,0 then to their latest position on the server. Basically a teleport.

## Mirror

- Default Transform Settings
    - Unreliable Transform
- Server port: 25565
- Uses `FixedUpdate()` at 20hz
- Issue:
    - Late Joiners doesn’t replicated properly If Player prefab & auto register player is off
    - NT doesn’t replicated properly if target is child transform instead of root transform

## Fusion v2 [Need to be Verified]

- Client port: 40000+ (Random)
- Server port: 40000+ (Random)
- Default Transform Settings
- Replication Feature: Scheduling
- Issue:
    - Only 255 Objects spawned on client if replication feature is set to None
    - Objects doesn’t get replicated to client if objects is spawned after client is joined
    - Assumption: Fusion v2 Scheduling only sends the snapshot after 2 ticks because the packet size is too big

## Comparison

- Fusion v2 might be inaccurate due to this [Assumption: Fusion v2 Scheduling only sends the snapshot after 2 ticks because the packet size is too big]
