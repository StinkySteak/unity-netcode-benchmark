## Fusion v2 [Need to be Verified]

- Client port: 40000+ (Random)
- Server port: 40000+ (Random)
- Default Transform Settings
- Replication Feature: Scheduling
- Issue:
    - Only 255 Objects spawned on client if replication feature is set to None
    - Objects doesn’t get replicated to client if objects is spawned after client is joined
    - Assumption: Fusion v2 Scheduling only sends the snapshot after 2 ticks because the packet size is too big

| Move All Axis | 79 | 4,764,029 |
| Move Wander | 85 | 5,138,963 |

## Comparison

- Fusion v2 might be inaccurate due to this [Assumption: Fusion v2 Scheduling only sends the snapshot after 2 ticks because the packet size is too big]
